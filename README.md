# URL-Shortener
A simple application to shrink and access your URLs while saving all the previously shrinked URLs

In this project, I use MongoDB, Express, Node.js, EJS, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create the URL shortener.

When a URL is posted on the site, the URL is stored in the database and a shorter URL is created which when clicked redirects to the actual website

Every URL entered by the user is stored and displayed in the table below the the URL field
